## About Me

Good day. I'm Daisuke Nishioka. I'm a third year Computer Science and Economics Double Major. I'm also the President of UCSD Iaido and the Vice President of UCSD Kendo, two martial arts clubs where we fight each other with **swords**
which I think is *pretty cool* if you ask me though my face up above might say otherwise. I also like video games, anime, vtubers, music, debate, and assembling PCs. You can find more information about me in my [README](README.md). 

## Experience

I'm still a student so my experience is quite limited but I'd say I'm pretty confident in my abilities. Here's what I've learnt:

>*start early, start often* -- Some UCSD CSE Prof, 2018

and 

```
system.out.println("Hello, world");
```

Jokes aside, here's a list of what I can do:
1. Write code in:
  - Java
  - C
  - C++
  - ARM Assembly
2. Create my own datastructures such as:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Binary Trees
  - Self-balancing Trees
  - Treaps
3. Read, write, and speak:
  - English
  - Japanese
  - French
4. Communicate with precision and accuracy drawing from experiences from:
  - 2 Highschool Debate Tournament Gold Medals
  - Speaker experience with TedxYouth@Tokyo
